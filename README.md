### Images

    The images throughout show that the business is a beauty therapy provider. They have specifically been chosen as they have tones and hues of pinks and greys, which is in keeping with the website colour scheme.

    All the images, apart from the hero image on the landing page, have a shadow effect to give the image a slightly raised, 3-dimensional feel to them. The cordners have been rounded off to provide a softer visual effect.
