The images throughout show that the business is a beauty therapy provider. They have specifically been chosen as they have tones and hues of pinks and greys, which is in keeping with the website's main colour scheme.

### Treatments Page

This page of the website gives a little information about the treatments on offer, which are accompanied by images corresponding to the treatment. Below this section a price list has been provided, which has been styled in keeping with the colour schemme.

The font-family used is Oswald and Lato, which complement each other. The back up font used is sans-serif, should there be any issues in loading the chosen fonts. The font colour is a charcoal-grey or a very dark grey, which provides good contrast with the background.

Some of the images, forms and location map have a shadow effect to give them a slightly raised, 3-dimensional feel to them. The corners have been rounded off to provide a softer visual effect, which is easier on the eye
