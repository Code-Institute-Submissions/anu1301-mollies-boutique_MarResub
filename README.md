## User Experience (UX)
[Go up to the top](#table-of-contents)

The aim was to design a website that would provide an informative first contact for the user and entice them to book with the salon for all their beauty therapy needs.

The target audience the website is aimed at is professional women within the agae range of 20 - 40, who want to be pampered.

The website provides three pages - the landing page to entice the user to explore further, treatment page providing treatments and prices and finally the contact page, where they can make their booking and find the contact details of the salon.

The website is easy to navigate and is fairly intuitive, and is designed to be responsive on various sized devices; therefore easy to access on the go.

The images throughout show that the business is a beauty therapy provider. They have specifically been chosen as they have tones and hues of pinks and greys, which is in keeping with the website's main colour scheme.

### Treatments Page

This page of the website gives a little information about the treatments on offer, which are accompanied by images corresponding to the treatment. Below this section a price list has been provided, which has been styled in keeping with the colour schemme.

The font-family used is Oswald and Lato, which complement each other. The back up font used is sans-serif, should there be any issues in loading the chosen fonts. The font colour is a charcoal-grey or a very dark grey, which provides good contrast with the background.

Testimonials provided below the price list, have been styled in keeping with the rest of the website.

Some of the images, forms and location map have a shadow effect to give them a slightly raised, 3-dimensional feel to them. The corners have been rounded off to provide a softer visual effect, which is easier on the eye
